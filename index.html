      <h1>Why Environmental Awareness Is Important!</h1>
      <h3 class="contents"> Why Is Environmental Awareness Important?
        Human activities such as pollution, deforestation, and over consumption can have negative impacts on the
        environment. These activities can lead to environmental degradation, resulting in serious consequences for
        humans and the environment, such as climate change, habitat loss, and resource depletion. It is for this reason
        that environmental awareness is so important.<br>

        Most people are unaware of the various ways in which they can help the environment. It is important to be
        environmentally aware so we can do our part in preserving our planet. There are many things we can do to be more
        environmentally conscious, such as recycling, using less water, and using energy-efficient appliances.<br>

        Environmental awareness is important because our earth provides resources that are essential to our well-being
        and quality of life. These resources include clean air, water, and soil, as well as a wide range of plants and
        animals that contribute to the richness and diversity of our planet.<br>

        Another reason why environmental awareness is so crucial is that it can help people live healthier lives. People
        can protect themselves and their families from health risks by learning about the dangers of air pollution,
        water contamination, and toxic chemicals.<br>

        Our environment is not only essential for our survival but also home to a variety of animal and plant species.
        Due to human activity, many species are at risk of extinction, and this loss of biodiversity can have a serious
        negative impact on ecosystems.<br>

        By raising awareness of these environmental issues, we can help protect these vulnerable species and preserve
        the natural resources of our earth for future generations. Moreover, being more environmentally aware could help
        to reduce some of the effects of climate change, as well as reduce our impact on the planet. This can help to
        ensure that the resources and services provided by the earth will continue to be available to us and other
        living things.

      <h1>Major Environmental Problems</h1>
      <h3 id="EnvironmentalIssues" class="contents">Air Pollution – When the atmosphere is filled with toxic gases
        released as result of industrial or other economic activities, it results in polluting the atmosphere and the
        air in the environment. This is nothing but air pollution.<br><br>
        Water Pollution – With the natural water resources depleting day by day, water is a scarce commodity. But, even
        in these times, the water sources are polluted by pollutants from various sources, making them unfit for human
        consumption.
        <br><br>
        Garbage Pollution – When we do not adhere to proper waste disposal mechanisms, waste accumulates, causing
        garbage pollution. So the only way to address this issue is to ensure a proper waste disposal system that does
        not contaminate the environment.

        Environmental degradation is the disintegration of the earth or deterioration of the environment through the
        consumption of assets, for example, air, water and soil; the destruction of environments and the eradication of
        wildlife. It is characterized as any change or aggravation to nature’s turf seen to be pernicious or
        undesirable.

        Ecological effect or degradation is created by the consolidation of an effectively substantial and expanding
        human populace, constantly expanding monetary development or per capita fortune and the application of asset
        exhausting and polluting technology.

        <p>
          Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called
          pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such
          as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.

          Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes.
          Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can
          pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and
          harm wildlife.

          All living things—from one-celled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earth’s supply of air and water. When
          these resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened.

          Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside, pollution
          can spread to remote places where no people live. For example, pesticides and other chemicals have been found
          in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of microscopic
          plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

          Air and water currents carry pollution. Ocean currents and migrating fish carry marine pollutants far and
          wide. Winds can pick up radioactive material accidentally released from a nuclear reactor and scatter it
          around the world. Smoke from a factory in one country drifts into another country.

          <p>
            Resource Depletion
            More people require more food, water, energy, and other resources for their own survival. As these become
            increasingly scarce due to overpopulation, it becomes harder for us to sustain our current way of life.

            Environmental Degradation
            As more people consume resources, they create waste and pollution that can degrade the environment. This can
            lead to soil erosion, water pollution, and other forms of damage that can have severe consequences.

            Deforestation
            Overpopulation leads to an increased demand for housing, food, and resources, which can lead, among other
            things, to deforestation. We lose approximately 10 million hectares a year. This results in the loss of
            animal habitats and exacerbates climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that can be absorbed
            by plants.

            Social Unrest
            Overpopulation can lead to overcrowding, poverty, food insecurity, and other social issues. This can create
            tension between communities and countries as resources become increasingly scarce.

            Loss of Biodiversity
            In 2020, WWF reported that over the last 50 years, we have seen an average 68% decrease in the populations
            of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. As habitats are destroyed to make way for human
            habitation, the diversity of wildlife decreases. This has a negative impact on the food chain and can
            threaten entire species with extinction.

                Landfills pollute the environment and destroy the beauty of the city. Landfills come within the city due
                to the large amount of waste that gets generated by households , industries , factories and hospitals.
                Landfills pose a great risk to the health of the environment and the people who live there. Landfills
                produce foul smell when burned and cause substantial environmental degradation.

                  <p>
                    Forests cover 31% of the land area on our planet. They help people thrive and survive by, for
                    example, purifying water and air and providing people with jobs; some 13.2 million people across the
                    world have a job in the forest sector and another 41 million have a job that is related to the
                    sector. Many animals also rely on forests. Forests are home to more than three-quarters of the
                    world’s life on land. Forests also play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they
                    act as a carbon sink—soaking up carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and
                    contribute to ongoing changes in climate patterns.

                    But forests around the world are under threat, jeopardizing these benefits. The threats manifest
                    themselves in the form of deforestation and forest degradation. The main cause of deforestation is
                    agriculture (poorly planned infrastructure is emerging as a big threat too) and the main cause of
                    forest degradation is illegal logging. In 2019, the tropics lost close to 30 soccer fields' worth of
                    trees every single minute.

                    Deforestation is a particular concern in tropical rain forests because these forests are home to
                    much of the world’s biodiversity. For example, in the Amazon around 17% of the forest has been lost
                    in the last 50 years, mostly due to forest conversion for cattle ranching. Deforestation in this
                    region is particularly rampant near more populated areas, roads and rivers, but even remote areas
                    have been encroached upon when valuable mahogany, gold, and oil are discovered.

                    WWF has been working to protect forests for more than 50 years. WWF works with governments,
                    companies, communities and other stakeholders to promote certification for responsible forest
                    management practices, combat illegal logging, reform trade policies, protect forested areas, and
                    more.
